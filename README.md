# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 where a missing `return` statement in a page component causes an unexpected error.  The `about.js` file initially lacks a return statement, leading to the error. The `aboutSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.
5. Visit `/about` in your browser.  You should see an error.

## Solution

The solution is simple: Ensure that every page component has a `return` statement to render JSX. The corrected code is provided in `aboutSolution.js`.
